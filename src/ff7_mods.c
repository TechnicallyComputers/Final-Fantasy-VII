/* ff7_mods.c — game-owned trusted mod plugins for Final Fantasy VII.
 *
 * Widescreen is MOD-OWNED on PSX: the runtime hardcodes ws_offered = false and
 * clamps the display aspect to 4:3 after every config source, so neither
 * game.toml nor a stale settings.toml can engage it. The only thing that can
 * is a trusted activation callback, which runs after the launcher's final
 * mod-plan commit and before renderer/window initialization — exactly the
 * window in which a display aspect can still be chosen.
 *
 * See psxrecomp/docs/MOD_PACKAGES.md ("Trusted static plugins") and
 * runtime/include/mod_plugins.h.

 * Hook trace — the instrument that turns a "contextual" name into a confirmed
 * one.
 *
 * symbols.toml carries ~580 function names imported from the ff7-decomp symbol
 * map. Per recomp-ai-rules/LICENSING.md §5 those are tagged status =
 * "contextual": evidence-backed, but UNVERIFIED BY US, and a contextual name
 * must never be cited as evidence. This feature is how you discharge that —
 * enable it, do the thing the name claims to describe, and see whether the call
 * actually fires.
 *
 * It is READ-ONLY. It calls no psx_mod_write_*, changes no guest state, and
 * alters no timing beyond the host-side printf. Nothing here breaks
 * faithfulness, so it needs no ENHANCEMENTS.md policy decision.
 *
 * The hook set is not written out here. It is generated into psx_symbols.h from
 * every symbols.toml entry with hook = true, so adding a hook is a one-line
 * edit to the map — never a hex address typed into C
 * (psxrecomp/docs/SYMBOLS.md: "Do not leave newly identified functions as raw
 * hex in host hooks").
 *
 * The call sites themselves are emitted by the recompiler from game.toml
 * [recompiler] mod_function_entry_funcs, so a change to the hook set only takes
 * effect after generated/ is rebuilt. `tools/sync_symbols.py --check-hooks`
 * fails when those two drift apart.
